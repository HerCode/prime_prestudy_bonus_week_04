#Splinter Challenge

Create a JavaScript file named 'script.js' and add a 'splinter' function. The function should:
     Take in 2 numbers as arguments
     Multiply those numbers, and save the result to a locally scoped variable called 'z'.

Next:
    Create an array that stores the first argument, second argument, and z.
    Return that array.

Try testing this by console logging the splinter function, passing in 1 and 2. Check all of this into a repo called "prime_prestudy_bonus_week_04"
